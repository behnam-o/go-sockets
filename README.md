# Sockets in Go

A basic overview of socket programming in golang. 
This project includes a client and a server written in go.
Start the server by running the following from the `server/` directory:

```
go run server.go
```

And then the client, from the `client/` directory:

```
go run client.go
```

The client program reads input from standard input and sends it to the sever
The server replies by repeating what it hears.
